# V3Utils

## What is V3Utils?

V3Utils is a fork of V3Utils created by [Revert Finance](https://github.com/revert-finance/v3utils). The modified functions are specifically related to the swap, where the call to the 0x API has been removed and replaced with a call to the UniSwap router contract.

The intention of this fork is to use these contracts to expand the functionality of (Seedle)<https://seedle.finance>.

You can find an implementation of this contract in the repository: [Seedle Finance] (<https://github.com/scobru/uniswap-v3-pools/tree/feat_OnChainCompound_ClosePosition_Collect>)
